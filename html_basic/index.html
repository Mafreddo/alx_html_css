            INFORMATION PROGRAMMING</h1>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>The SABC occupies a distinctive position of trust in the lives of its viewers and listeners. We are
            the most extensive, all-inclusive and diverse news organisation in South Africa. The SABC
            considers it a duty to provide consistent, relevant, useful and top-quality information and
            analysis on which all South Africans can rely as they discuss and deliberate, form opinions and
            build a common future.</p>
        <p>The Independent Broadcasting Authority Act, the Broadcasting Act, the Code of Conduct for
            Broadcasters and the SABC's Editorial Code set out the essential requirements for news and
            current affairs services that are to be studied, understood and observed by every member of the
            SABC's news staff.</p>
        <p>This policy covers all the news, current affairs and information programming broadcast by the
            SABC, including news bulletins and current affairs programmes provided for radio, television and
            SABC Africa.</p>
        <h3>THE SABC'S ROLE IN NEWS, CURRENT AFFAIRS AND
            INFORMATION PROGRAMMES</h3>
        <p>The SABC recognises the important part played by news and information in human, social and
            economic growth and development, especially in societies such as ours that are embarking on
            nation building. The SABC takes account of this, as it is in these circumstances that news,
            current affairs and information services can be the catalyst for positive and progressive
            development and change</p>
