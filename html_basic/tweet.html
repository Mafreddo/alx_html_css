        <article>THE SABC'S ROLE IN NEWS, CURRENT AFFAIRS AND
            INFORMATION PROGRAMMES
        </article>
        <aside>
            <p>The SABC recognises the important part played by news and information in human, social and
                economic growth and development, especially in societies such as ours that are embarking on
                nation building. The SABC takes account of this, as it is in these circumstances that news,
                current affairs and information services can be the catalyst for positive and progressive
                development and change.</p>
